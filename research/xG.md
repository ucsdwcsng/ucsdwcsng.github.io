Wireless systems have evolved to send in more and more bits across, and faster. This is evident from simple voice calls in 1-2G to seamless video calls in 3-4G and leading towards AR/VR support in 5G. However, in the nextG (6G and beyond), wireless networks need to be strongly application driven. This translates to the race to get higher throughput showing signs of stagnation, and promoting relook of wireless networks with an eye towards flexibility, reliability and the application QoS metrics. 

In WCSNG, we envision the nextG to rely more on virtualized networks that provide flexibility, and efficient integration of wireless technologies with networking stacks to promote reliability and best sofwarized control of the networks. Towards this end, we have projects that span across multiple layers, frequency bands and applications of wireless networks. 

* **Achieveing sustainable, dense 6G network with low-power MIMO base-stations**: In this project, we showcase our vision for next generation wireless network, by promoting densification while handling interference effectively by leveraging MIMO concepts. With years of research behind MIMO, there are few real-world deployments, since it right now lacks a central application to build around. We believe by enabling low-power enough MIMO, densification can be one killer application for MIMO and promote real world networks utilizing this cool technology.

* **Reliable, Cross-Domain Adaptable mmWave networks**: mmWave networks have the potential to unlock the required high throughputs and serve the upcoming AR/VR innovations. However, the real-world adoption has been scarce, with mmWave shown to be often unreliable due to the large signal losses inculcated at these 10s of GHz freqeuncy bands. We show how to make mmWave as reliable as a wired link by pursuing innovating mmWave beam designs, and augmenting the network with cross-domain knowledge from other sensors like radar, in order to offset the large path loss challenge.

* **NextG network optimization and control with low-latency AI**: With the advent of software-defined networking, there has been a paradigm shift in the cellular network landscape, leading towards virtualization and disaggregation. Open RAN promotes open interfaces to facilitate data collection for comprehensive network analysis. Furthermore, it also promotes embedding control hooks directly into cellular network functions. These are critical steps towards actualizing the vision of an intelligent network, where optimization and control are not just possible, but are fundamental aspects of the network's operation. We incorporate low latency AI capabilities to cellular networks to make realtime network decisions possible, this is crucial to enable the diverse range of end user applications anticipated in the next generation of mobile communication. 

<!-- EdgeRIC. As wireless networks go to nextG, with more bands, and multiple involved physics (MIMO, mmWave), it would be a challenging task for even a human being to operate the network, let alone do it efficiently. We incorporate AI concepts at wireless management layers (core network) to operate this large wireless network with efficiency, and automated manner. 

<!-- However, this doesn’t align well with the move towards green alternatives for the upcoming wireless generation, as most of the existing throughput-optimal wireless networks fail to be energy efficient and sustainable. Further, even with a sharp increase in throughput, networks still deal with issues of blockage and dead spots, which hamper the reliability of a wireless link.  -->

<!-- Towards, this end, WCSNG innovates on , I will present GreenMO, which has the potential to make Massive MIMO more sustainable, by incorporating hardware virtualization concept across multiple antennas and saving circuits/RF front end power consumption. Then, I will present mmReliable, which shows how mmWave networks can be made reliable to blockage effects by utilizing multiple directional beams instead of a single blockage-prone beam. -->

<!-- Millimeter-wave wireless communications with high throughput are poised as enablers of augmented reality, virtual reality, ultra-HD video applications, and many more. Utilizing the fallow spectrum at mmwave is expected to provide gigabits-per-second data rates to multiple users. However, the sad reality of the day is that users with 5G mmwave are deployed and connect only 0.5% of the time to the mmwave base station, making it unreliable. Moreover, the reliability suffers significantly due to user mobility and blockage, making the entire 5G mmwave ineffective. Major Carriers around the world, including Verizon, have paused their 5G mmwave developments. The core bottleneck for reliability is the use of high-directional beams for mmwave communication, which is required to overcome the path loss and, hence, have a single point of link failure. Furthermore, to compound the fact most beam recovery algorithms are re-active, act after the link has degraded. My research endeavors to develop wire-like, reliable, and high throughput mmwave connectivity links. We built the world’s first high throughput and highly reliable mmwave link by using multi-beam directed along multiple strong paths, creating a coherently combined link at the receiver, and tracking algorithms for proactive multi-beam optimization. We have also developed the world’s first 5G mmwave testbed and publicly shared data sets. Looking towards the future, we are developing reliable for a large number of users, mm-wave phased array architecture geared towards multi-beam, and enabling fine-grained slicing for mmwave connectivity. This work was sought out by media news outlets and industry. -->
