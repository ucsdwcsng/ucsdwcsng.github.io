    - title: "How multi-beams support multiple users without loosing power per-beam"
      text: "Modern mmWave systems have limited scalability due to inflexibility in performing frequency multiplexing. All the frequency components in the signal are beamformed to one direction via pencil beams and cannot be streamed to other user directions. We present a new flexible mmWave system called mmFlexible that enables flexible directional frequency multiplexing, where different frequency components of the mmWave signal are beamformed in multiple arbitrary directions with the same pencil beam. Our system makes two key contributions: (1) We propose a novel mmWave front-end architecture called a delay-phased array that uses a variable delay and variable phase element to create the desired frequency-direction response. (2) We propose a novel algorithm called FSDA (Frequency-space to delay-antenna) to estimate delay and phase values for the real-time operation of the delay-phased array. Through evaluations with mmWave channel traces, we show that mmFlexible provides a 60-150% reduction in worst-case latency compared to baselines."

    - title: "Delay-Phased Array Architecture Details"
      text: "DPA architecture consists of programmable delay and programmable phase element per antenna with a single-RF chain. These elements can be programmed together to create flexible beam responses that are not possible by either of the two elements alone. Our insight is to control two knobs: delays τn and phase Φn to get the desired response."

osd: "Our dataset which consists of multiple indoor and outdoor experiments for up to 30 m gNB-UE link. In each experiment, we fixed the location of the gNB and move the UE with an increment of roughly one degrees. The table above specifies the direction of user movement with respect to gNB-UE link, distance resolution, and the number of user locations for which we conduct channel measurements. Outdoor 30 m data also contains blockage between 3.9 m to 4.8 m. At each location, we scan the transmission beam and collect data for each beam. By doing so, we can get the full OFDM channels for different locations along the moving trajectory with all the beam angles. Moreover, we use 240 kHz subcarrier spacing, which is consistent with the 5G NR numerology at FR2, so the data we collect will be a true reflection of what a 5G UE will see."
