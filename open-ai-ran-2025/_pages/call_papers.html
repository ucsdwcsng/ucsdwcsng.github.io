        <p align="justify">Open RAN is a new mobile network technology concept replacing the current Radio Access
          Network architecture based on vendor-specific implementations with an approach based
          on standard specifications, using disaggregated functions working on general-purpose
          hardware and supporting equipment interoperability from multiple vendors. Open RAN
          helps mobile operators open their networks and allow rapid innovation and deployment of
          new research and ideas in service automation, network visibility, data insight, intelligent
          control, AI/ML, security, etc.
          Open RAN and AI are set to revolutionize the future of wireless technology in the
          commercial sector. By capitalizing on the advancements within existing 5G networks,
          businesses are preparing to transition to 6G and beyond. This evolution requires a swift and
          innovative approach to ensure that enterprises are equipped with cutting-edge data
          management, transmission, and processing capabilities, meeting the demands of ultra-low
          latency and high reliability.</p>
          
          <p align="justify">
          Open RAN has been an area of industry prioritization in many countries. Over $1B in
          government funding is dedicated to Open RAN R&D in the US alone. AT&T has set the goal of
          70% of its RAN traffic being on an open platform by 2026. The UK government has set the
          goal of 35% of network traffic being over Open RAN by 2030. Vodafone also has a goal of
          30% of its European networks being Open RAN by 2030. Many technical issues need to be
          addressed before Open RAN can deliver its promises.
          ACM MobiCom is a premier international forum addressing mobile wireless networks. Open
          RAN is one of the most important technological trends in industry. We need to have a
          dedicated forum at the MobiCom conference to energize academic involvement and foster
          exchanges and collaborations.</p>

          <p align="justify">

          This workshop will explore the latest research activities in Open RAN networks, leveraging
          open architecture, open interface, open-source technologies, and accessible software
          APIs. This workshop will also explore AI technologies in RAN to enable new capabilities for
          next-generation networks. The workshop will act as a forum for researchers and developers
          across academia and industry to exchange ideas and share results on the design of future
          mobile wireless networks. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:

         </p>

      <li>RAN design, architecture, and implementation</li>
      <li>Open-source approaches, open-source components for RAN</li>

        All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the submission website (details at the end of this page). All submitted papers will be evaluated through a double-blind reviewing process, with the identities of the authors withheld from the reviewers.
        Before final submission, you are expected to make sure that your paper complies with the following requirements. Please do not violate these requirements with the aim of including additional material: submissions that violate the formatting requirements may not be reviewed. 
<!--You can visually inspect a page-by-page report of your paper format using the same tool as the submission system via a separate ​online form. After the submission deadline, we will use the same tool to check the conformance of papers. The format checking tool uses heuristics and can make mistakes. The PC chairs will manually inspect and possibly reject those papers with evident format violations. However, no paper will be rejected due to format violations without being manually checked. -->

        Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be immediately rejected:

		<br/>
        
		<ul>
          <li>Page limit: 6 pages, including all references.</li>
	<li>Font size no smaller than 10 points. The camera-ready papers can have font size of 9 points</li>
          <li>Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.</li>
          <li>Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).</li>
          <li>Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted.</li>
          <li>Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity.</li>
          <li>Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit.</li>
          <li>You may find these <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" style="color:blue" target="_blank">templates</a> useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use​\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}​. But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify (manually or through the above online paper checker) that your submission is format-compliant.</li>
          
        </ul>
