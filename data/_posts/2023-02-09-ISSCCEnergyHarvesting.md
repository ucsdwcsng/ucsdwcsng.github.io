    - text: "In this work, we developed a self sustaining backscattering chip to enable a single device like interrogation of IoT backscatter tags. The developed tag can harvest energy from the LTE signals emitted by a mobile device and backscatters an incident BLE signal by embedding the Iot data in the form of a WiFi packet."
