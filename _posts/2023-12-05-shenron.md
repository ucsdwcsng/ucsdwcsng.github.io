Radar Simulations have become an essential tool
in radar algorithm development and testing due to the lack of
available high-resolution radar datasets and enormous difficulty
in acquiring real-world data. However, simulating radar data is
challenging as existing radar simulation tools are not easily accessible, require detailed mesh inputs and take hours to simulate.
To address these issues, we present SHENRON, an open-source
framework that efficiently simulates high-fidelity MIMO radar
data using only lidar point cloud and camera images. We show
that with SHENRON, one can generate simulated data that can be
used to evaluate algorithms as effectively as on real data. Further,
one can perform quick iterations through a vast parameter space
of the radar to find the best set of parameters for any application,
significantly aiding research in radar perception and sensor fusion.
