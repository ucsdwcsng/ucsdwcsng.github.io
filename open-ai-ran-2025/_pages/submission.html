        All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the <a href="https://s3-2023.hotcrp.com/" style="color:blue">S<sup>3</sup> 2023 submission website</a>. Authors should prepare a PDF version of their papers. You may use these <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">templates</a> helpful in complying with the requirements.
        Paper submissions should be no longer than 3 pages in font size no smaller than 10 points, including figures and references, in standard ACM conference format. Demos and poster submissions should consist of a one-page abstract in the same format describing the demonstration plan or the outline of the poster content. We encourage students with a paper, poster, or demo at ACM MobiCom main conference to present their work at this workshop as well.
