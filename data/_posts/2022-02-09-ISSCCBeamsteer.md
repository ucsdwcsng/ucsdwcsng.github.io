    - text: "In this work, we propose a low power architecture to backscatter a WiFi or BLE signal from Tx access point to Rx access point that are located in arbitrary direction. We achieved this by using multiple antennas on the tag and performing beamforming of the backscattered signal. The beamforming capability is realized by using a digital phase shifting mechanism instead of analog phase shifters to have an efficient and low cost operation of the tag."
