Enabling reliable mm-wave communication for xG networks:

Millimeter-wave wireless communications with high throughput are poised as enablers of augmented reality, virtual reality, ultra-HD video applications, and many more. Utilizing the fallow spectrum at mmwave is expected to provide gigabits-per-second data rates to multiple users. However, the sad reality of the day is that users 5G mmwave are deployed connect only 0.5% of the time to the mmwave base station, making it unreliable. Moreover, the reliability suffers significantly due to user mobility and blockage, making the entire 5G mmwave ineffective. Major Carriers around the world including Verizon have paused on their 5G mmwave developments. 
The core bottleneck for the reliability is the use of high-directional beams for mmwave communication, which is required to overcome the pathloss, hence, have a single point of link failure. Furthermore, to compound the fact most beam recovery algorithms are re-active, act after the link has degraded. My research endeavors to develop wire-like reliable and high throughput mmwave connectivity links. We built the worldâ€™s first high throughput and high reliable mmwave link by using multi-beam directed along multiple strong-paths, creating a coherently combined link at the receiver, and tracking algorithms for proactive multi-beam optimization. We have also developed the world's first 5G mmwave testbed and publicly shared data sets. Looking towards the future, we are developing reliable for a large number of users, mm-wave phased array architecture geared towards multi-beam and enabling a fine-grained slicing for mmwave connectivity. This work was sought out by media and news outlets, and industry.
