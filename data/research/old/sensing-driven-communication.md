With ever-increasing data-rate requirements for different applications, optimizing the existing wireless networks from sub-6 GHz to THz is needed. The wireless networks need to be driven by sensing the entire spectrum to achieve optimized performance. Even with my work on full-duplex radios, the radios would be limited to sensing a fraction of the spectrum and cannot cover the entire spectrum. My vision has been to design networks driven by global sensing of the spectrum, instead of individualized sensing. Cloud management of RAN can use the sensing information to optimize the entire network of base-stations. Thus, in the emerging spectrum landscape, sensing needs to achieve high agility in space, time, frequency, and dynamic range is necessary for next-generation network optimization. The core bottleneck is to enable a low-cost entire spectrum sensing with a high-time resolution, which led to no cognitive radio deployments to facilitate dynamic spectrum use. Furthermore, it is extremely hard to sense the entire spectrum with fine resolution in time, space, and simultaneously sense weak and the strong signals that are spectrally close. 

My research has designed a low-cost, mobile sensor that sweeps the spectrum capturing the spectral activity for every frequency for a short period and reconstructs the entire spectral activity, demonstrating the world’s first low-cost, entire sub-6 GHz of spectrum captured in millisecond. My work introduced a sweeping receiver architecture that limits the sub-set of spectrum band and captures the ADC samples. Such an architecture leads to the short observation of each signal, which, combined with signal processing and machine learning, can detect accurately and preserve users’ privacy. It continuously sweeps the entire spectrum rapidly, allowing for signals on the different bands to naturally appear one at a time for a short period and then disappear. This technique effectively provides high resolution for spectrum sensing. It allows the receiver to sense strong signals when they are swept with sweeping architecture and blocks strong signals when they are sweep-sensing a weak signal. The next core bottleneck is shipping the sensed data in real-time to feedback to the core network (which turns out to be 800 Mbps of data from a single sensor) near impossible to ship. My research has developed SparSDR, which is an edge-compression technique that can compress (by 200x) the observation of spectrum and ship only helpful information to the cloud with low latency, building necessary tools to enable sensing-driven communication. The low-cost sensor that can sense the entire spectrum and quickly ship essential data from the sensor has evolved research on privacy and security of communications. Specifically, in our recent work, we showed that Bluetooth radios could uniquely be profiled with hardware signatures be and tracked by our sensors, even if they continuously change MAC address, leading to zero privacy for users. Our work on sensing exposes the privacy and security flaws of wireless networks. 

This work from my group on sensing solves a long-standing problem, needed by recent calls from NSF Spectrum Innovation Initiative (SII) and many DoD organizations across the US are working to enable sensing of the incumbents like weather or military radar in the spectrum to allow the co-existence with commercial use. This also led to a multi-million dollar funded program by IARPA (SCISRS). Looking towards the future, we are working on designing networks that can react to the feedback, starting with cellular and then with decentralized WiFi networks. Based on a theoretical study, the expectation is that it would improve the spectral efficiency by 5000x. Sensing becomes fundamental to mm-wave frequency and sub-THz frequency as discovering the link itself is challenging with highly directional beams. My efforts are on generalizing this approach across mm-wave/THz to propose the design of low-cost, mobile spectrum sensors that can quickly gather global spectrum observations across the four dimensions and enable network optimization.

In this set of projects, I use advanced quanitative methods to tackle the problem of more accurately measuring concepts of interest in international relations. One uses Bayesian latent variable models to directly assess the strength of peace agreements in civil conflict rather than having to use agreement duration as a proxy for strength. Another harnesses advances in big data and develops new measures of economic interdependence and methods for detecting disruptions of regular economic exchange between states from a product-level trade dataset with over two billion observations.

> Much of the peace agreement durability literature assumes that stronger peace agreements are more likely to survive the trials of the post-conflict environment. This work does an excellent job identifying which provisions indicate that agreements are more likely to endure. However, there is no widely accepted way to directly measure the strength of agreements, and existing measures suffer from a lack of nuance or reliance on subjective weighting. We use a Bayesian item response theory model to develop a principled measure of the latent strength of peace agreements in civil conflicts from 1975-2005. We illustrate the measure’s utility by exploring how various international factors such as sanctions and mediation contribute to the strength or weakness of agreements.

Rob Williams. "Measuring Peace Agreement Strength in Civil War."

> This paper presents the Peace Agreement Strength Scores (PASS) of peace agreements in civil conflicts. The scores capture the strength of peace agreements at the time of signing and can be used to avoid relying on the duration of agreement survival as a proxy for agreement strength. The scores are used to show descriptively that stronger peace agreements tend to be signed in more intractable conflicts, suggesting that a selection effect may be at play in the process of agreement signing and duration. The scores are available for all peace agreements signed in UCDP/PRIO civil conflicts from 1975-2018.

> Border disputes between states can be very costly and disruptive, including major disruptions in trade. From an aggregate perspective, scholars traditionally expect these costs and disruptions to place pressure on states to avoid or resolve these disputes quickly. This view, however, risks oversimplification of the quality of trade and the economic actors driving that trade. We investigate the consequences of complex trade relations on border disputes. Variation in the composition of trade, whether characterized by uniqueness on the global market or readily available substitutes, generates variation in the presence and intensity of domestic pressure to avoid or resolve border disputes. We examine the effects of this variation on dispute behavior using an original dataset that combines product-level trade data (spanning from 1962-2001) with ICOW territorial claims data. The use of product-level trade data allows for the analysis of substitutability options which may reduce exit costs and make it easier to escalate border disputes. This analysis helps us better understand the choice to forego trade due to border disputes, and furthers our understanding of the economic impact of unsettled borders.

David B. Carter, Bailee Donahue, and Rob Williams. "Border Walls, Cooperation, and Illicit Trade." To be presented at Annual Conference of the International Political Economy Society, Columbus, OH, November, 2020.

> In the last twenty years, the number of fortified borders around the world has risen precipitously. A growing body of research shows that cross-border economic inequality drives wealthier states to construct border walls. This surge in walls is further argued to be a reaction to the unwanted "externalities"" of economic openness and globalization, namely, illicit trade and smuggling. While recent studies analyze the effect of walls on legal trade, no studies of which we are aware explore how walls might affect illicit trade. This is a notable omission for two key reasons. First, the most common explanation for wall construction puts combating illicit trade front and center. Second, recent work that finds walls significantly reduce legal trade suggest that this finding derives from border fortifications diverting illegal trade to ports of entry, which leads to more inspection, security, and transaction costs. We begin to fill this gap here by developing new measures of illicit trade flows and assessing their connections to border wall construction and legal trade flows.
