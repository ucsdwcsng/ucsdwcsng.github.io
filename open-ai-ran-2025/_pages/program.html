            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b>  The INDIGO (Intelligent “All G” Networks Designed and Integrated for Globalized Operations) project, part of NSF’s Convergence Accelerator Track G program, seeks to enhance the adaptability, security, and resilience of 5G/xG networks for public safety and peacekeeping missions. This effort integrates Human-Centered AI for multi-operator network orchestration, particularly in scenarios requiring rapid deployment, such as natural disasters or defense situations. INDIGO leverages open standards, including O-RAN, 3GPP, and TMF, along with interoperable platforms, to enable adaptive network management and service restoration across diverse operator networks. The INDIGO prototyping effort relies upon COSMOS, an indoor/outdoor city-scale testbed established as part of the NSF PAWR initiative that is now being augmented via the NTIA PWSCIF ACCoRD project.</font><br>

            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> The architecture and deployment of mobile networks, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decade, driven by the adoption of “disaggregation” at multiple levels. This shift has fostered a more diverse and open telecom ecosystem. Today, we are entering a new era for the RAN, where another major opportunity awaits: the transition to data-driven, AI-powered RAN operations with even greater disaggregation and openness. However, this evolution also brings new challenges, much like the earlier phase of disaggregation. In this talk, I will focus on two key challenges — the efficient acquisition of RAN data and troubleshooting in a disaggregated RAN — and outline our GenAI-based solutions to address them.</font><br>

            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> In the rapidly evolving landscape of robotics, AR/VR/XR, automotive perception, and machine learning applications, it has become evident that traditional approaches to network optimization focused solely on throughput and latency are insufficient. To deliver an enhanced user experience, it is crucial to consider additional network metrics such as jitter and application state awareness. Such requirements are not traditional considered during the standardization and nor are easy to optimize.

                In this talk, I would first present the limitations of existing RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) in adapting to highly mobile wireless channels, which restricts their ability to meet the on-demand needs of applications. While these controllers may offer macro level network optimizations, I will next introduce EdgeRIC—a realtime RAN intelligent controller that leverages the power of AI, specifically Reinforcement Learning, to elevate the performance of ORAN (Open RAN) stacks and address the diverse requirements of various applications in realtime. Decoupled from the RAN stack, EdgeRIC functions as an intelligent controller that employs AI-powered optimization techniques to provide control decisions to the RAN across multiple-layers. Next, to train these AI models, we have developed a digital twin that ensures spatial and temporal consistency of the wireless channel. Our deployment showcases the integration of EdgeRIC with an open-source ORAN stack, highlighting the remarkable over-the-air performance improvements achieved. Notably, we present compelling results, demonstrating a substantial 75% reduction in video streaming stalls with an application aware intelligent scheduling policy.</font><br>
            <font size="2"><b>Bio:</b> Prof. Dinesh Bharadia has been an associate professor in the ECE department at the University of California San Diego since July 2022, where he directs the WCSNG group. He received early promotion to a tenured professorship and held Assistant Professorship for four brief years from 2018 – 2022. He received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2016 and was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT. Specifically, he built a prototype of a radio that invalidated a long-held assumption in wireless that radios cannot transmit and receive simultaneously on the same frequency, which inspired research on this topic from different communities (communication theory to RFIC). From 2013 to 2015, he worked to commercialize his research on full-duplex radios, building a product that underwent successful field trials at Tier 1 network providers worldwide like Deutsche Telekom and SK Telecom. This product is currently under deployment. He serves as a technical advisor for multiple startups. Dinesh was named to Forbes 30 under 30 for the science category worldwide list in recognition of his work. Dinesh was named a Marconi Young Scholar for outstanding wireless research and was awarded the Michael Dukakis Leadership Award. MIT Technology Review also named him one of the top 35 Innovators under 35 worldwide in 2016.

            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> AI has greatly changed almost every industry. AI for cellular radio access network (RAN) has also achieved its momentum. Following state-of-the-art research results, which revealed the potential for large performance gains by applying AI/ML techniques in RAN, the wireless industry is now broadly pushing for the adoption of AI in 5G and future 6G technology. However, despite this enthusiasm, there are a lot of challenges when deploying AI in RAN and AI-based wireless systems still remain largely untested in the field. Common simulation methods for generating datasets for AI model training suffer from “reality gap,” in that they fall short of accurately representing real-world networks. As a result, the performance of these simulation-trained models may not carry over to practical cellular systems. In this talk, we will introduce some details of the challenges and some existing efforts to solve these issues.</font><br>

            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> Despite known vulnerabilities in cellular networks, standardization
                bodies like GSMA and 3GPP have been reluctant to implement
                comprehensive security fixes. While intelligence agencies continue to
                develop sophisticated tools like IMSI catchers, their solutions remain
                hidden from the academic community. When questioned about security
                gaps, these organizations often claim 'no one exploits these
                vulnerabilities' - even as they leave core vulnerabilities unpatched.
                To bridge this gap between known vulnerabilities and practical
                exploitation, we propose 'Cellular Metasploit', a comprehensive
                toolkit for testing cellular network security. In this talk, I will
                discuss its design, implementation, and how it can drive more
                transparent discussions about cellular security.</font><br>

            <font size="2"><b>Abstract:</b> Virtualization of telco networks is beginning to happen in Radio Access Networks (RAN), especially regarding Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). However, there are some obstacles to this trend. The current O-RAN architecture limits programmability to predefined telemetry and control that an xApp can access through existing, standardized service models which may limit the pace of innovation.

                To address this limitation and unleash O-RAN's full potential, Microsoft has developed Project Janus, programmable RAN platform technology that introduces flexible, dynamically loadable service models. The proposed architecture is primarily based on the existing O-RAN architecture. The main difference is the dynamic service model, whose functionality can be implemented by the application designer and deployed at run-time without affecting RAN operations. All this flexibility does not come at the cost of reliability, safety, or security.
                
                New applications of analytics and automation are possible with the flexibility of dynamic service models and low latency, including RAN energy efficiency and anomaly detection. New applications are able to access almost all information available at different layers of RAN and exercise control at many different levels of RAN. As a result, Open RAN has the potential to significantly accelerate the pace of RAN transformation, making it possible to achieve the full benefits of 5G sooner.</font><br>
