    - title: "How much should our mobile networks densify?"
      text: "With uniform densification of base-stations, the dependency on power amplifiers to transmit at unreasonble high powers reduces and opens the doors for greener wireless networks. At the same time, large-scale densification will lead to mushrooming of base-station hardware, which will start consuming more power. Hence, there exists a green-point of densification. Checkout our short HotCarbon’22 workshop paper which shows empirical models on green densification levels! "
