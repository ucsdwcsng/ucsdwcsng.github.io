This paper presents the design and implementation of the first in-band full duplex WiFi radios that can simultaneously transmit and receive on the same channel using standard WiFi 802.11ac PHYs and achieves close to the theoretical doubling of throughput in all practical deployment scenarios. Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.
