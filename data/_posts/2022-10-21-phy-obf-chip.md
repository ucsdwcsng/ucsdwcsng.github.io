This brief presents the analysis, design, and measurement results of an integrated circuit designed to prevent
tracking the location of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters. Conventional BLE transmitters have unique RF fingerprints
due to variation-induced imperfections in the underlying circuits.
Coupled with BLEâ€™s wide adoption in mobile devices and tendency to transmit continuously, BLE has become a significant
threat to the location privacy of individual users. The primary
source of this privacy threat is that BLE transmitters have a
unique Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) that can be easily fingerprinted by passive adversaries. To combat this, a test chip is
developed that pseudo-randomly changes its CFO by switching in
a binary-weighted set of semi-identical MIM capacitors into the
tank of an LC voltage controlled oscillator, all while maintaining compatibility with BLE standard specifications. Measurement
results reveal that privacy preservation can be improved from
only a few seconds with a conventional design, to over a day with
the proposed design.
