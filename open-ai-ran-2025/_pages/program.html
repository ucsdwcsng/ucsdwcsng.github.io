                                <b>Abstract:</b> 6G will redefine mobile networks as intelligent, AI-native infrastructures rather than pure connectivity platforms. Central to this transformation is the AI-Native Radio Access Network (AI-RAN), where AI is embedded into the design, operation, and optimization of the RAN. This keynote introduces the three dimensions of AI-RAN: AI-for-RAN, enhancing efficiency and performance; AI-on-RAN, enabling AI-driven services; and AI-and-RAN, utilizing distributed compute within the RAN for AI workloads. The presentation will also highlight the role of the AI-RAN Alliance, a global initiative of operators, vendors, academia, startups and government bodies driving collaborative innovation. Together, these efforts illustrate how AI-Native 6G RAN can unlock new economic value and intelligent services across industries.
